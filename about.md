I'm Vinicius Brasil, a 19-year-old software developer based in Curitiba, Brazil. I have always been intersted in technology. My first contact with computer programming was when I was 14-year-old to help my mother on her small business finances. I wrote a simple program with Visual Basic and used Microsoft Excel as a pseudo database. I see programming as a mere tool to solve our problems and facilitate our lives.

* I started my carrer when I was 16 years old to work with Windows applications development for a retail management software
* I've participated in many hackathons with different subjects, such as: health, ecology, educations, and so on
* In 2018 I decided to start writing articles to improve my English skills and to share my thoughts on technology

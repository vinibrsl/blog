## Business-minded software developer

I've always had an interest in technology. My first contact with computer programming was when I was 14, to help my mom in her small business finances. I wrote a simple macro with Visual Basic, using Microsoft Excel. For me, [programming is a mere tool to solve our problems and facilitate our lives](https://medium.com/hackernoon/you-are-not-paid-to-write-code-daf42c9ebc33).

That's why I refer to me as a **business-minded** software developer. There's no point in programming if there are no problems to solve. My toolchain these days are Ruby, Rails, Elixir, Phoenix, and JavaScript, although I have also worked with C#, Java, Python, Go, and some other tech. I believe that [languages are there to solve specific problems](https://medium.com/hackernoon/do-not-be-this-kind-of-developer-480072581f1b). You might have your favorite, but most likely it's not applicable to every problem there is.

## Passionate writer

I love writing. Not just tech articles but emails, bug reports, pull requests, documentation.

In 2018 I started writing tech articles to share my thoughts on programming, product, and tech. I've written for [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/do-not-be-this-kind-of-developer-480072581f1b), [The Startup](https://medium.com/swlh/how-ux-can-grow-your-business-c6781766392e), and also [my personal blog](https://vnbrs.com/four-practical-tips-for-improving-your-programming-focus/).

## Choir section leader

Music has always been part of my life. I volunteer as a section leader in my church's choir. [Here's a picture of them singing in an annual event called "MAP: O Segredo"](https://i.imgur.com/WAvJnnz.png).

## Theology student

I'm majoring in Theology. I dream of merging my programming skills and my faith. I have started some projects on this, but still in development.
